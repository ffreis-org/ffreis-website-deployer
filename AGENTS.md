# Agent Context

**This repo:** `ffreis-website-deployer` — GitHub Actions workflows that orchestrate
CI/CD for the entire website fleet. The central `deploy.yml` reads from the inventory
repo to build and promote any managed website. The `local/` directory contains the
docker-compose watch stack used by `ffreis-siteops` for local development.

For the complete system map — how this repo relates to siteops, the compiler,
the inventory, S3 infrastructure, and the individual websites — see the private
fleet inventory repository:

> `FelipeFuhr/ffreis-website-inventory` → `AGENTS.md`

Architecture detail (CI/CD job graph, design decisions): `AGENTS.md` links to
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same repo.

Do not look for cross-component flow documentation in this repo's README;
it covers only the deployer's own workflows and local runtime.
