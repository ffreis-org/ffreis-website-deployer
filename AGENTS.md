# Agent Context

**This repo:** `ffreis-website-deployer` — GitHub Actions workflows that orchestrate
CI/CD for the entire website fleet. The central `deploy.yml` reads from the inventory
repo to build and promote any managed website. The `local/` directory contains the
docker-compose watch stack used by `ffreis-siteops` for local development.

For the complete system map — how this repo relates to siteops, the compiler,
the inventory, S3 infrastructure, and the individual websites — see the private
fleet inventory repository:

> the fleet inventory (private repo — do not name it in commits or PR descriptions)

Architecture detail (CI/CD job graph, design decisions): `AGENTS.md` links to
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same repo.

Do not look for cross-component flow documentation in this repo's README;
it covers only the deployer's own workflows and local runtime.

## Public repo — private-repo hygiene

This is a **public** GitHub repository. When writing commit messages, PR titles,
PR descriptions, or any other user-visible text, **never name private repos** —
website content, inventory, infra, Lambda, or data repos that are not publicly
listed. Use generic terms instead: "the fleet inventory", "a private consumer",
"internal infra", "private data repo", etc.

## Compiler embedding flags in inventory YAML

The `compiler` section of each inventory YAML can carry optional fields that control
how the compiler embeds resources into HTML during CI builds:

```yaml
compiler:
  repo: ...
  ref: main
  js_inline_threshold: 32768        # optional; compiler default = 8192 (8 KB); 0 = disable
  js_shared_inline_threshold: 8192  # optional; scripts on >1 page use this lower limit; -1 = off
  raster_inline_threshold: 2147483647  # optional; compiler default = 0 (disabled); large = all
  embed_fonts: false                # optional; default false
  inline_body_css: false            # optional; default false
```

These fields are site-level (not per-deployment). The `deploy.yml` config job
extracts them from `top_compiler` and passes them as matrix outputs:
`compiler_js_inline_threshold`, `compiler_js_shared_inline_threshold`,
`compiler_raster_inline_threshold`, `compiler_embed_fonts`, `compiler_inline_body_css`.
The build step converts them into the matching compiler flags.
